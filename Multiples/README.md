# Zoe's Arrays Prompt

I chose to recreate the paintbrush example from the notion however I wanted the brush to chose randomly from a set chosen colours I had selected. Originally I struggled to achieve this but was able to find many examples online that demonstrated how to select randomly from an array. I combined the techniues I saw to finish this prompt.
